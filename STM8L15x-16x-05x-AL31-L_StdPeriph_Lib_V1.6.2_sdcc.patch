     Depending on the application memory model, the memcpy() or fmemcpy() functions
     should be used to perform the copy.
!        In case your project uses the SMALL memory model (code smaller than 64K),
         memcpy()function is recommended to perform the copy
!        In case your project uses the LARGE memory model, functions can be 
        everywhere in the 24-bits address space (not limited to the first 64KB of
        code), In this case, the use of memcpy() function will not be appropriate,
        you need to use the specific fmemcpy() function (which copies objects with
        24-bit addresses).
        - The linker automatically defines 2 symbols for each inram function:
!             __address__functionname is a symbol that holds the Flash address 
             where the given function code is stored.
!             __size__functionname is a symbol that holds the function size in bytes.
       And we already have the function address (which is itself a pointer)
    4- In main.c file these two steps should be performed for each inram function:
!       Import the "__address__functionname" and "__size__functionname" symbols
         as global variables:
           extern int __address__functionname; // Symbol holding the flash address
           extern int __size__functionname;    // Symbol holding the function size
!       In case of SMALL memory model use, Call the memcpy() function to copy the
        inram function to the RAM destination address:
                  memcpy(functionname, // RAM destination address
                        (void*)&__address__functionname, // Flash source address
                        (int)&__size__functionname); // Code size of the function
!       In case of LARGE memory model use, call the fmemcpy() function to copy 
       the inram function to the RAM destination address:
                   memcpy(functionname, // RAM destination address
                        (void @far*)&__address__functionname, // Flash source address

        you need to use the specific fmemcpy() function (which copies objects with
        24-bit addresses).
        - The linker automatically defines 2 symbols for each inram function:
!            __address__functionname is a symbol that holds the Flash address 
             where the given function code is stored.
!            __size__functionname is a symbol that holds the function size in bytes.
       And we already have the function address (which is itself a pointer)
    4- In main.c file these two steps should be performed for each inram function:
!      Import the "__address__functionname" and "__size__functionname" symbols
         as global variables:
           extern int __address__functionname; // Symbol holding the flash address
           extern int __size__functionname;    // Symbol holding the function size
!      In case of SMALL memory model use, Call the memcpy() function to copy the
        inram function to the RAM destination address:
                  memcpy(functionname, // RAM destination address
                        (void*)&__address__functionname, // Flash source address
                        (int)&__size__functionname); // Code size of the function
!      In case of LARGE memory model use, call the fmemcpy() function to copy 
       the inram function to the RAM destination address:
                   memcpy(functionname, // RAM destination address
                        (void @far*)&__address__functionname, // Flash source address

+ Toolchain Installation for SDCC
+ =================
+ 
+   - if required, download and install [SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net/) and Gnu-Make. Add binaries to $(PATH)
+   - for STM8 programming via SWIM debug interface
+     - install libusb-dev (e.g. `sudo apt-get install libusb-1.0-0-dev`)
+     - download and make [stm8flash](https://github.com/vdudouyt/stm8flash) source code
+     - on Linux grant write access to ST-Link debugger by creating a file `/etc/udev/rules.d/99-stlinkv2.rules` with content  
+     `SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="3744", MODE="0666"`  
+     Note: since several versions of ST-Link exist, check the idProduct of your device via command `usb-devices`
+   - for STM8 programming via serial bootloader
+     - download and make [stm8gal](https://github.com/gicking/stm8gal) source code
+   - if necessary, set execute permission for build scripts in project folders
+ 
+ ### Notes
+ 
+   - the SPL projects are also compatible with other compilers and IDEs, e.g. [Cosmic](http://www.cosmic-software.com/) and [STVisualDevelop](http://www.st.com). These are not tested or supported by the build scripts, but allow graphical debugging which is not yet supported by SDCC 
+   - on Windows
+     - SWIM upload can also be performed via [STVisualProgrammer](http://www.st.com). Please adapt build scripts accordingly
+     - bootloader upload can also be performed via [Flash Loader Demonstrator](http://www.st.com). However, this is not supported by the automatic build
