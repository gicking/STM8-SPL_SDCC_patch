+ # This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
+ # doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
+ #
+ # All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
+ # front of the TAG it is preceding.
+ #
+ # All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
+ # The format is:
+ # TAG = value [value, ...]
+ # For lists, items can also be appended using:
+ # TAG += value [value, ...]
+ # Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").

+ #---------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ # Project related configuration options
+ #---------------------------------------------------------------------------
+ 
+ # This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the config file
+ # that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all text
+ # before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the iconv
+ # built into libc) for the transcoding. See http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv
+ # for the list of possible encodings.
+ # The default value is: UTF-8.
+

+ # The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
+ # double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
+ # project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the

+   @par Project description
+ 
+   This folder contains a standard STVD template workspace that includes 11 
+   projects related to the FW Lib supported products.
+   Each project includes all the user-modifiable files that are necessary 
+   to create a new project.
+   These project templates can be used by mean of minor updates in the library files
+   to run the FWLib examples, or custom user applications. 
+ 
+   
+   - project\\template\\STVD\\Cosmic
+      - project.stw              Workspace file
+      - stm8s103.stp             Project file for STM8S103 Low-density devices. 
+      - stm8s003.stp             Project file for STM8S003 Low-density devices.
+      - stm8s105.stp             Project file for STM8S105 Medium-density devices.
+      - stm8s005.stp             Project file for STM8S005 Medium-density devices.
+      - stm8s207.stp             Project file for STM8S207 High-density devices.
+      - stm8s007.stp             Project file for STM8S007 High-density devices.
+      - stm8s208.stp             Project file for STM8S208 High-density devices.
+      - stm8s903.stp             Project file for STM8S903 Low-density devices.
+      - stm8af52ax.stp           Project file for STM8AF52Ax High-density devices.
+      - stm8af62ax.stp           Project file for STM8AF62Ax High-density devices.
+      - stm8af626x.stp           Project file for STM8A Medium-density devices.
+ 
+ 
+   @par How to use it ?
+ 
+   - Open the STVD workspace
+   - Set active the project related to the used product: Project-> Set Active Project, 
+   and choose the desired project 
+   - Select your debug instrument: Debug instrument-> Target Settings, select the 
+   target you want to use for debug session (Swim Stice or Swim Rlink)
+   - Rebuild all files: Build-> Rebuild all. 
+   - Load project image: Debug->Start Debugging
+   - Run program: Debug->Run (Ctrl+F5)
+   
+   @b Tip: If it is your first time using STVD, you have to confirm the default 
+   toolset and path information that will be used when building your application, 
+   to do so:
+     - Select Tools-> Options
+     - In the Options window click on the Toolset tab
+     - Select your toolset from the Toolset list box.
+     If the path is incorrect you can type the correct path in the Root Path 
+     field, or use the browse button to locate it.
+     - In the subpath fields, type the correct subpath if necessary 
+   
+  @note
+   - High-Density STM8A devices are the STM8AF52xx STM8AF6269/8x/Ax,
+     STM8AF51xx, and STM8AF6169/7x/8x/9x/Ax microcontrollers where the Flash memory
+     density ranges between 32 to 128 Kbytes
+   - Medium-Density STM8A devices are the STM8AF622x/4x, STM8AF6266/68,
+     STM8AF612x/4x, and STM8AF6166/68 microcontrollers where the Flash memory 
+     density ranges between 8 to 32 Kbytes
+   - High-Density STM8S devices are the STM8S207xx, STM8S007 and STM8S208xx microcontrollers
+     where the Flash memory density ranges between 32 to 128 Kbytes.
+   - Medium-Density STM8S devices are the STM8S105x and STM8S005 microcontrollers
+     where the Flash memory density ranges between 16 to 32-Kbytes.
+   - Low-Density STM8S devices are the STM8S103xx, STM8S003 and STM8S903xx microcontrollers
+     where the Flash density is 8 Kbytes.

+   @par Project description
+ 
+   This folder contains a standard STVD template workspace that includes 11 
+   projects related to the FW Lib supported products.
+   Each project includes all the user-modifiable files that are necessary 
+   to create a new project.
+   This project templates can be used by mean of minor updates in the library files
+   to run the FWLib examples, or custom user applications. 
+   
+   
+   @par Directories contents
+   
+   - project\\template\\STVD\\Raisonnance
+      - project.stw              Workspace file
+      - stm8s103.stp             Project file for STM8S103 Low-density devices.

+ 
+   @par How to use it ?
+ 
+   - Open the STVD workspace
+   - Set active the project related to the used product: Project -> Set Active Project, 
+   and choose the desired project 
+   - Select your debug instrument: Debug instrument -> Target Settings, select the 
+   target you want to use for debug session (Swim Stice or Swim Rlink)
+   - Rebuild all files: Build-> Rebuild all. 
+   - Load project image: Debug->Start Debugging
+   - Run program: Debug->Run (Ctrl+F5)
+   
+   @b Tip: If it is your first time using STVD, you have to confirm the default 
+   toolset and path information that will be used when building your application, 
+   to do so:
+     - Select Tools-> Options
+     - In the Options window click on the Toolset tab
+     - Select your toolset from the Toolset list box.
+     If the path is incorrect you can type the correct path in the Root Path 
+     field, or use the browse button to locate it.
+     - In the subpath fields, type the correct subpath if necessary 
+   
+  @note
+   - High-Density STM8A devices are the STM8AF52xx STM8AF6269/8x/Ax,
+     STM8AF51xx, and STM8AF6169/7x/8x/9x/Ax microcontrollers where the Flash memory
+     density ranges between 32 to 128 Kbytes
+   - Medium-Density STM8A devices are the STM8AF622x/4x, STM8AF6266/68,
+     STM8AF612x/4x, and STM8AF6166/68 microcontrollers where the Flash memory 
+     density ranges between 8 to 32 Kbytes
+   - High-Density STM8S devices are the STM8S207xx, STM8S007 and STM8S208xx microcontrollers
+     where the Flash memory density ranges between 32 to 128 Kbytes.
+   - Medium-Density STM8S devices are the STM8S105x and STM8S005 microcontrollers
+     where the Flash memory density ranges between 16 to 32-Kbytes.
+   - Low-Density STM8S devices are the STM8S103xx, STM8S003 and STM8S903xx microcontrollers
+     where the Flash density is 8 Kbytes.
